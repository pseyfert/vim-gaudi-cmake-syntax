Extension of standard CMake 'add_library' command.
Create a library from the specified sources (glob patterns are allowed), linking
it with the libraries specified and adding the include directories to the search path >

GAUDI-PROJECT                                                  *gaudi_project* {{{1

Main macro for a Gaudi-based project.
Each project must call this macro once in the top-level CMakeLists.txt,
stating the project name and the version in the LHCb format (vXrY[pZ]).

The USE list can be used to declare which Gaudi-based projects are required by
the broject being compiled.

The TOOLS list can be used to declare the tools version to be used. These contribute to
the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH and CMAKE_MODULE_PATH but are not themselves treated as projects.

The DATA list can be used to declare the data packages requried by the project
runtime.

The FORTRAN option enable the FOTRAN language for the project. >

                [USE proj1 vers1 [proj2 vers2 ...]]

GAUDI-DEPENDS-ON-SUBDIRS                                  *gaudi_depends_on_subdirs* {{{1

The presence of this function in a CMakeLists.txt is used by gaudi_sort_subdirectories
to get the dependencies from the subdirectories before actually adding them.

The fuction performs those operations that are not needed if there is no
dependency declared.

The arguments are actually ignored, so there is a check to execute it only once. >

  gaudi_depends_on_subdirs(subdir1 [subdir2 ...])
